* Guide: Computer Science and Web Development - comprehensive path  
  Note: [[https://forum.freecodecamp.com/users/kevcomedia][@kevcomedia]] has ported the entire list into a Trello board you can clone to keep track of your 
  progress you can find the Trello board [[https://trello.com/b/4v9dpn3G/cs-wd][here]].

  Note: Scroll to the bottom and read the "Things to Keep in Mind" section. It contains information about 
  how to approach the list that is just as important as the list itself.

  Note: This Guide is heavier on computer science than the other, if you want less of the heavier computer 
  science and more on practical web development you might want to check out 
[[https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-web-development-with-computer-science-foundations-comprehensive-path/64516][  Guide: Web Development with Computer Science Foundations - comprehensive path ]] as well and pick the one 
  that most meets your goals.
** Prerequisite 
   The only things that you need to know are how to use Git and GitHub. Here are some resources to learn about them:
   Note: Just pick one of the courses below to learn the basics. You will learn a lot more once you get started!
   + [[https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1][Try Git]]
   + [[http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/][Git - the simple guide]]
   + [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-][GitHub Training &amp; Guides]]

  There WILL be math. And, it's important. If the thought frightens you, or bores you, or has you thinking
  "this isn't for me", head to [[https://www.khanacademy.org/][Khan Academy]] right now, sign up, and start devoting 30 minutes a day. This 
  is an investment that will pay off. I'm not making this up.

** Bookmarks you should have
   + [[https://surge.sh/][surge.sh]] - deploy your frontend projects here (or use github pages)
   + [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/][MDN]] - look HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stuff up here
   + [[https://dashboard.heroku.com/][Heroku]] - deploy your fullstack projects here (or hyperdev)
   + [[https://firebase.google.com/][Firebase]] or [[https://mlab.com/][mLab]] - database hosting
   + [[https://github.com/][GitHub]] - store your code here
   + [[https://material.google.com][Material Design]] - lean on this when you need a structure for creating a minimalistic but awesome looking site
   + [[https://www.materialpalette.com/][Material Palette]] - for selecting color schemes
   + [[https://www.wirify.com/][Wirify]] - for quickly turning a web page into a wireframe so you can see the big picture instead of all the graphics
** Things to keep in mind
    + have git commits every week, most of the days of the week
    + try to get in one of [[https://forum.freecodecamp.com/users/tropicalchancer/activity][@tropicalchancer's]] cohorts - be active once you're in
    + try to pick one to two other languages to use regularly for solving algorithms and implementing projects in addition 
      to JavaScript (good choices would be to pick one of C++, Java or Python and one of Golang or Rust).
*** For each item you should:
    + take notes, on a blog, in markdown, wherever, somewhere - not about what you read, or about what the instructor said - 
      about what you learned
    + build something - even if it's just a 20 line function that computes something you find interesting
    + if you build something, document it and test it as appropriate
    + do the exercises, build the projects - fully, not some scaled down halfassery
*** For four projects of your chosing
    + Seek 1-3 other developers to collaborate on the project
    + Coordinate with the team to complete the project
    + Build the project out to a full production quality application
    + Invite others who are not associated with the team to rigorously test the final product.
    + Resolve any legitimate issues found
*** Once per month - do two or more of the following
    + Write up a comprehensive blog post or markdown entry in a repository detailing the high points of what you learned that month
    + Watch this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIb9l3imAo][video]] and this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5-tdAwclo][video]] - on interviewing
    + Read [[http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007_09_01_archive.html][this]] - on crafting a resume
    + Do one lesson from [[https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=345][CUST104: Business Communications]]
    + Live stream what you're working on for an hour. Or, lend a hand to someone who needs help by screensharing and walking them through it.
    + Catch up on industry reading on sites like [[https://www.joelonsoftware.com/][Joel on Software]], [[https://blog.codinghorror.com/][Coding Horror]], [[https://css-tricks.com/][CSS Tricks]], [[http://alistapart.com/articles][A List Apart]], [[http://uxmyths.com/][UX Myths]], [[http://javascriptweekly.com/][JavaScript Weekly]]
*** if you need a breather from an item, do one of these, then get back to it
    + complete a project from FCC that isn't included in this list
    + pick a pet web development project you can code in a week and complete it
    + code another android application
    + write a guide for the FCC wiki or create a video tutorial and post it to YouTube
    + learn golang or rust and complete any of the backend projects from FCC with that language as the backend language
    + redo any of the algorithmic type projects you've already completed from the list, in a language other than JavaScript
    + pick an open source project from [[https://www.codetriage.com/][Code Triage]] and contribute to fixing an open issue
    + visit the FCC forum and pick a couple of the toughest questions, that people are having trouble getting help with, and help them
    + code a flash cards application, for jotting quick notes you can use to quiz yourself later
